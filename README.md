Suggested use of the predictive model

To use the calculator, users will input data for the following variables of the HCW that constitute the prediction model: age in years, socioeconomic status (low, middle and high according to local definitions.  For instance, in our country, it depends on the economic strata that are used to classify the place of residency), occupation, main hospital service where the person works, symptoms at presentation (fever and chills, cough, fatigue/weakness, diarrhea, anosmia or dysgeusia), history of asthma, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status (not vaccinated, incomplete schedule, complete schedule). 

It is also essential for the prediction to input an estimate of the local level of viral circulation when the HCW presents for care. An approximation to this level is based on the positivity of the SARS-CoV-2 tests in the population. We recommend that users obtain this positivity percentage from local public health authorities or their institutionâ€™s occupational health team. In Colombia, for example, this information can be accessed on the National Institute of Health website (https://www.ins.gov.co/Noticias/Paginas/coronavirus-pcr.aspx).

Based on the results, the calculator also provides guidance on the need or not for additional testing. In the context of a respiratory peak with high levels of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the population (test positivity equal of greater than 15%) and prediction of a high probability of infection, the healthcare worker should be managed as potentially infected, and isolation protocols should be initiated without further testing. Conversely, if the calculator estimates a low probability of infection for the HCW, a molecular COVID-19 test is recommended to reduce the risk of false negatives, as the model has demonstrated limited sensitivity and the risk of being infected is relatively high given the epidemiological situation.

In the context of low to moderate levels of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the population (test positivity below 15%) and a prediction of a high probability of infection, we suggest that the healthcare worker be considered potentially infected, without further testing. However, if the model predicts a low probability of infection in this context, the worker can be considered not infected.
